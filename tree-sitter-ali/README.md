Tree-sitter parser for Ali (AL Improved) programming language. Not the usual tree-sitter parser, but instead made to be easily usable in transpiler [alic](https://github.com/ramojus/alic).

Ali is mostly the same as AL language, but the syntax is improved to be more familiar and comfortable for most programmers. To see how Ali differs from AL, check out `input` and `output` files in [alic](https://github.com/ramojus/alic) project. This parser is made to support all unchanged AL syntax (not just the changed parts), but the syntax is huge and AL language does not have any official specification, so I might have missed something.
